### Problem 0

This “problem” focuses on structure of your submission, especially the
use git and GitHub for reproducibility, R Projects to organize your
work, R Markdown to write reproducible reports, relative paths to load
data from local files, and reasonable naming structures for your files.

### Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and … columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are user /
order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There
are also item variables – name, aisle, department, and some numeric
codes.

How many aisles, and which are most items from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Let’s make a plot

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    filter(n > 10000) %>% 
    mutate(
        aisle = factor(aisle),
        aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
    ) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Let’s make a table\!\!

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
    group_by(aisle) %>% 
    count(product_name) %>% 
    mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
    filter(rank < 4) %>% 
    arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
    knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Apples vs ice cream..

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
    group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
    summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
    pivot_wider(
        names_from = order_dow,
        values_from = mean_hour
    )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

\#Problem 2

``` r
accel_data = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity.1:activity.1440,
    names_to = "minute",
    names_prefix = "activity.",
    values_to = "activity"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    minute = as.numeric(minute),
    day_1 = day, 
    day_1 = recode(day, "Monday" = "1" ,"Tuesday" =  "2", "Wednesday" = "3", "Thursday" = "4", "Friday" = "5", "Saturday" = "6", "Sunday" = "7"),
    weekday_type = ifelse(day_1 > 5, "weekend", "weekday"),
    day = factor(day, order = TRUE, levels = c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday", "Thursday" , "Friday", "Saturday","Sunday"))
  ) %>% 
  arrange(day) %>% 
  select(-day_1)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
accel_data
```

    ## # A tibble: 50,400 x 6
    ##     week day_id day    minute activity weekday_type
    ##    <dbl>  <dbl> <ord>   <dbl>    <dbl> <chr>       
    ##  1     1      2 Monday      1        1 weekday     
    ##  2     1      2 Monday      2        1 weekday     
    ##  3     1      2 Monday      3        1 weekday     
    ##  4     1      2 Monday      4        1 weekday     
    ##  5     1      2 Monday      5        1 weekday     
    ##  6     1      2 Monday      6        1 weekday     
    ##  7     1      2 Monday      7        1 weekday     
    ##  8     1      2 Monday      8        1 weekday     
    ##  9     1      2 Monday      9        1 weekday     
    ## 10     1      2 Monday     10        1 weekday     
    ## # … with 50,390 more rows

There is 50400 rows and 6 columns in this dataset. The variables
contains : *week: from 1 to 5 *day\_id: from 1 to 35 *day: Monday to
Sunday *weekday\_type:(weekday or weekend): *minute(the minute of the
day): *activity: the activity counts for each minute

There is 50400 observation.

-----

Create a readable table showing total activity for each day.

``` r
total_activity_a_day = 
  accel_data %>% 
  group_by(week,day) %>% 
  summarize(
    total_each_day = sum(activity)
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
table_for_total = 
  total_activity_a_day %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "day",
    values_from = "total_each_day"
  )

knitr::kable(table_for_total, digits = 2)
```

| week |    Monday |  Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday |   Friday | Saturday | Sunday |
| ---: | --------: | -------: | --------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -----: |
|    1 |  78828.07 | 307094.2 |    340115 | 355923.6 | 480542.6 |   376254 | 631105 |
|    2 | 295431.00 | 423245.0 |    440962 | 474048.0 | 568839.0 |   607175 | 422018 |
|    3 | 685910.00 | 381507.0 |    468869 | 371230.0 | 467420.0 |   382928 | 467052 |
|    4 | 409450.00 | 319568.0 |    434460 | 340291.0 | 154049.0 |     1440 | 260617 |
|    5 | 389080.00 | 367824.0 |    445366 | 549658.0 | 620860.0 |     1440 | 138421 |

The trends are not apparent.

-----

Draw a plot to see the trends.

``` r
trends = 
  total_activity_a_day %>% 
  ungroup(week,day) %>% 
  mutate(day_number = row_number()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day_number, y = total_each_day, color = week)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
   scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = c(100000,200000,300000,400000), 
    labels = c("100000","200000","300000","400000")
    ) + 
  labs(
    x = "Day",
    y = "Total activity",
    caption = "Data from the Advanced Cardiac Care Center of Columbia University Medical Center"
  )
  
trends
```

<img src="P8105_HW3_ys3295_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="90%" />

Now we could see the trends of total activity for each day.

-----

Draw a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses
for each day.

``` r
accel_data %>% 
  group_by(day) %>% 
  mutate(hour_in_a_day = ceiling(minute/60)) %>%
  group_by(day, hour_in_a_day) %>% 
  summarize(sum_by_hour = sum(activity)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour_in_a_day, y = sum_by_hour, color = day)) + 
  geom_point(aes(group = day)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = day)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = c(100000,200000,300000,400000), 
    labels = c("100000","200000","300000","400000")
    ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24), 
    labels = c("0", "3", "6", "9", "12","15","18","21","24")
    ) + 
  labs(
    x = "Hour of each day",
    y = "Activity",
    caption = "Data from the Advanced Cardiac Care Center of Columbia University Medical Center"
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'day' (override with `.groups` argument)

<img src="P8105_HW3_ys3295_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

We could see that this man’s activity counts was high in 9pm on Friday
and was inactive during 0am to 8am everyday.
